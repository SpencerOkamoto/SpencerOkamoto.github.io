        <p>MedECC is a telemedicine web application using Angular and .NET 
        to provide a global network of healthcare professionals to support 
        underserved or remote communities. The app began as a patient monitoring 
        device for understaffed hospitals during Covid-19, then evolved into 
        a broader healthcare solution.</p>
    
        <p>Our team consisted of a front-end team (2-3), back-end team (2), 
        design team (1-2) and project leads (2). Our team worked in a fully 
        remote setting.</p>

        <h2>Background and Task</h2>
        <p>MedECC started as a response to overcrowding in hospitals during 
        the covid-19 main surges. Our goal was to create a telehealth solution 
        for remote monitoring expanding hospital resources and trained workers. 
        As vaccines rolled out, the overcrowding problem subsided. I was tasked 
        to rescope the current application into a product better representing 
        our client's needs.</p>
        <p><strong>Our Clients</strong> were globally distributed in India, 
        Mexico, and Zambia. They consisted of hospital administrators, 
        physicians, and nurses who participated in user research, surveys, 
        and state of development presentations.</p>
        <p><strong>Problem</strong> the initial prototype was only applicable 
        to the current crisis with no future plans for expansion.</p>
