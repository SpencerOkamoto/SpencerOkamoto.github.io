<section id="about" class="text">
    <p>I'm a Front-End Engineer with a passion for User Interface 
    Principles and Research. I aspire to be a Product Designer 
    where I can support clients with user centered practices.</p>

    <p>My industry experience began with MedECC as the
        <a [routerLink]="'/medecc'"><strong>Product Designer and UI Lead</strong></a> 
    motivated by the impact of a globally distributed healthcare platform. 
    This was the perfect opportunity for graduting in the first year of the 
    Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

    <p>I worked as a 
        <a [routerLink]="'/salton'"><strong>Data Analyst</strong></a> 
    at Scripps Institute of Oceanography and Planetary Physics where I 
    investigated the interaction of Lithium Mining, Lake Loading, and the 
    underlying geology of the Southern San Andreas Fault.</p>
