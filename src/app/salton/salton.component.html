    <p>The study began in Westmorland, California -- located South of 
    the Salton Sea and North of Brawley. A series of earthquakes hit 
    the area from September 30th through October 03rd.</p>

    <p>I investigate the interaction among fault blocks and 
    migration of fault energy on the Southern San Andreas Fault. 
    Using <strong>Python Data Visualizations</strong>, this 
    study became a starting point in documenting Earthquake Swarms. 
    </p>

    <p>Here are some Python scripts detailing how to access, clean, 
    and analyze <strong>US Geological Survey</strong> data. In my 
    analysis, I distinguish between Earthquake Swarms and Sequences.
